Probably the only thing worth telling from 2020 has been getting <span class="bw">**my ham radio licence**</span>. It is not something I came up with all of a sudden, but it's true I found the extra motivation to study the exam out from all the lockdowns, curfews, and the rest of the COVID-19 jazz.

It's been a short —and full of doubts— trip already but, and this is the reason-to-be of this post, one with a lot of nice and helpful people. It is difficult to know where to start when you have a million different modes, bands, radios, antennas, etc., to trim down so that you can get to buy your first one. After a lot of reading, I got an <span class="bw">**Anytone 878UV+**</span>:

The reason I chose the 878UV was being able to get on the air without having to spend a fortune on new equipment. Yes, one can use any analog handy talkie to talk through the repeaters but as far as I have seen, there is not much traffic in them. At least, not in Zaragoza's (see list [in URZ's website](http://urez.org/repetidores/)). With no people using the repeaters, it is difficult to learn. There was another option, though: going all HF. This wasn't working for me either because it would've meant spending a lot more money, probably in mid-range transceivers, antennas, etc. To be honest I discarded this option because I didn't want to buy "just-ok-for-now" models that are good as a beginnner and get old in a couple of years. So, 878UV+DMR. 

After some configuration, I got on the air and to my surprise everything was much better than I had thought. I started talking to people all over the world in no time, and even though I didn't know (I still don't) how to properly do QSOs, at least I was doing them. What was [QTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_code)? what was QRT? Why certain people don't use the [phonetic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet)? Many amateurs in the digital voice modes have years and years of experience, so why not follow the rules? Maybe they didn't learn them the way I did a couple of weeks ago, who knows. It is indeed difficult to understand certain callsigns because one expects certain amount of syllables for a letter!

## More on DMR
In DMR all you've got (sort of) is Talk Groups/Time Slots/Colour Codes and the repeater or hotspot you want to use. I will avoid getting into the details of what is what, but for now, think of them as a way of gathering people together (in different groups) over shared resources (repeaters, etc): I might use the same repeater as you, but I am interested in talking to the spanish amateurs ([214](https://brandmeister.network/?page=lh&DestinationID=214)), or the whole world amateurs ([91](https://brandmeister.network/?page=lh&DestinationID=91)), or you name it. Technical configuration apart, because of course there is a learning curve, operating this is way easier than all the bells and whistles required for HF with the SSB (USB/LSB), the channels, the band plans, etc; and surely people run QSOs at a lower pace, which makes it beginner-friendly. So, in my case and just for now, I'll concentrate on using [WebSDR](http://websdr.org/) for my HF learning while at the same time I practice myself using a less demanding _place_. WebSDRs are powerful, and allow you to _have_ a radio in many locations in the world. Yesterday, for example, using an SDR located in [Asturias](http://websdr.ea1ura.com/), I got to follow a very experienced amateur doing QSOs at a pace I had some trouble understanding the signal reports, callsigns, etc.

## Some very nice amateurs
As I said, after a couple of weeks I've been able to talk to people from Zaragoza on analog (VHF/UHF), getting some invaluable advice on radio equipment, signal reports (is this thing working?), or just very good company. And at the same time, I've been able to talk with people from all over the world on digital at any time of the day (a bless for us, night crawlers). A couple of days ago, one of the amateurs gave me a nice surprise. After our chat, he got my contact details from QRZ and wrote me an email saying thanks, giving some nice info on his hometown and, this is the best part, <span class="bw">**sending me my first QSL card**</span>. His name is Ben, located in Port Fairy, Victoria, Australia [(VK3TBS)](https://www.qrz.com/db/VK3TBS). Of course sending QSL cards is not mandatory, but for many amateurs, filling up one's walls with cards people sent you, either eletronically or by post, is by far the best part. After Ben's QSL I designed my very own QSL card straight away so that I could send him one myself. And this is the result:
