Probably the only thing worth telling from 2020 has been getting my ham radio licence. It is not something I came up with all of a sudden, but it's true I found the extra motivation to study the exam out from all the lockdowns, curfews, and the rest of the COVID-19 jazz.

It's been a short -and full of doubts- trip already, but -and this is the reason-to-be of this post- one full of nice and helpful people. It is difficult to know where to start when you have a million different modes, bands, radios, antennas, etc., to trim down so that you can get to buy your first one. After a lot of reading, I got an Anytone 878UV+ so that I could get to use the new digital modes (e.g. DMR) without having to buy too much equipment. After all, if I wanted to go all HF I'd need to spend a lot more money, and one thing I had clear in mind was I didn't want to buy "just-ok-for-now" models that are good as a beginnner and get old in a couple of years. Another thing I liked of the DMR is the fact that beyond some configuration one doesn't need to know how to properly operate on the more professional bands, as all you have is Talk Groups/Color Codes and the repeater or hotspot you want to use. This is way easier than all the bells and whistles of HF, and surely people run QSOs at a lower pace, which makes it beginner-friendly. For now, I'll concentrate on using [websdr](http://websdr.org/) for all 20m/40m/etc bands related stuff and listen, listen, and listen to learn: yesterday, for example, I got to follow a very experienced amateur doing QSOs at a pace I had some trouble understanding the signal reports, callsigns, etc. 

Back to DMR, after a couple of weeks I've been able to talk to people from all over the world, and to exchange my first QSL card thanks to Ben, in Australia [VK3TBS](https://www.qrz.com/db/VK3TBS). Of course this is not a mandatory part in radio, but it is indeed nice to fill up one's walls with cards people sent you, either eletronically or by post. Of course, I was surprised and designed my own QSL card straight away so that I could send Ben one myself. And this is the result:
