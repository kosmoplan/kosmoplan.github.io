## :~$ less gps_position&#9608;
So, what do navigators need in order to find their position on the earth's surface when they don't have a GPS?

They need an <span class="red">**almanac**</span>, prepared by the astronomers to forecast precisely where the heavenly bodies: the sun,
the moon, planets and navigational stars, are going to be, hour by hour, years into the future, relative to
the observatory that prepared the almanac - in modern times [Greenwich, England](http://www.visitgreenwich.org.uk/).

They need a <span class="red">**chronometer**</span> or some other means of telling the current time at the observatory that was the
reference point for the data in the almanac.

They need <span class="red">**charts**</span>, and it is the cartographer's job to provide accurate charts so that navigators can establish
their position in latitude and longitude or in reference to landmasses or the hazards of rocks and shoals.

They need a quick and easy <span class="red">**mathematical method**</span> for reducing the data from their celestial observations to a
position on the chart.

Finally, they need an angle-measuring instrument, a <span class="red">**sextant**</span>, to measure the angle of the celestial body
above a horizontal line of reference.
