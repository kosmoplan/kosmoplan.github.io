## :~$ less sognefjorden
If you've ever seen a picture of a fjord, chances are it was taken around [Sognefjorden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sognefjord): the longest and deepest fjord of them all. This beast of around 205 km long, 4.5 km wide (max) and 1.3 km deep (max) is so incredible that makes a trip to Norway well worth the money just by itself. I'll get into the details of some very interesting towns and things to see in general later, but before getting into business, let's take a [detour](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/detour) to understand a thing or two about what does it mean to be a _fjord_. 

### :~$ less the_fjord_story
Fjord is one of those few Norwegian words (together with ski, or "_snowshoe_") that have made it into the English language, meaning "_where one fares through_" in [Old Norse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse). Interestingly enough, this makes sense not only when talking about boats, but also when describing how the actual fjord was built by nature's favourite bulldozer, a **glacier**. There is a fundamental difference between a boat and a glacier though: a boat travels on water while a glacier, having no water to use, has to content itself with the actual **rock** underneath. As one can imagine the trip is bumpy and full of stuff **breaking** below the ice, but judging by the Norwegian scenery left behind I think we can safely say it was totally worth?

So TL;DR, a bad ass, heavy, merciless glacier living on top of rock slides through, cutting a beautiful valley _beatle_ by _beatle_, stone by stone, until at some point it meets with the sea or the ocean at the other side, getting all that hard worked valley flown and, as a result of that, making a convenient highway for the *vikings* to use while leaving (most of the times) huge mountains on both sides. The mountains that **you and I** will drive through some many hundred thousand years after. _Veldig bra_. _HÃ¸res bra ut_. All happy.
