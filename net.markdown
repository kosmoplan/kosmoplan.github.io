## Look up, let it in
The <span class="bw">**beauty of the universe**</span> above our heads is sometimes only accesible to those willing to spend the night out, probably freezing. I can't express with words what it means to me to carefully plan my target, pack my equipment and drive away from the city while everyone else sleeps. The moment in which I turn off my car engine and <span class="bw">**I hear the silence**</span>, only broken by the car keys hitting each other and my own breathing. 

A <span class="bw">**red light**</span> is turned on in the middle of the night and I put my gloves on. I get out the car, turn the radio on and set up my equipment. It's cold, but it doesn't matter, I know I am not alone. I know there are many others, in other places around the globe, following exactly the same steps as I am. It is hard to explain, <span class="bw">the feeling</span>. But I got help.
